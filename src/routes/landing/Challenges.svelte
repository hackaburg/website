		<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
			Your task is to develop an AI/LLM solution that bridges this digital divide. Specifically,
			your solution should:
		</p>
		<ul class="mt-4 text-lg">
			<li class="mt-4">
				1. Interpret and Explain Error Codes/Messages: Utilize the provided PDF containing a user
				manual and real machine error codes/messages. The AI should accurately interpret these
				codes/messages and provide clear, understandable explanations to users.
			</li>
			<li>
				2. Enhance Accessibility: Focus on making the technology accessible to all, particularly
				older adults and those less familiar with digital tools.
			</li>
			<li>
				3. Simplify User Interaction: Design the user interface to be intuitive and user-friendly,
				reducing complexity and making technology more approachable for everyone.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
			To support your development, we will provide real machine data and a comprehensive machine
			manual. These resources will help you create a solution that is both practical and applicable
			to real-world scenarios.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
			<b>Objective: </b>Ensure that technology becomes an aid, not a hindrance, in people's lives.
			Your solution should empower users, allowing them to maintain control over technology and
			derive genuine personal value from it.

		<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
			Use the provided hardware of microcontroller and sensors to build an interactive connected toy
			figure that reacts to how you play with it. Get creative and implement playful interactions
			between the player and the interactive toy you build. <br /><br />

			Hardware we provide and you can use:<br />
			ESP32 microcontrollers with WiFi and bluetooth and a huge variety of input sensors and output modules
			like camera, gyroscopes, accelerometers, compass module, battery, button, LEDs, speaker, display,
			SD card reader, breadboards, cables and more. There will also be several 3D printers available
			for use.

		<p class="mt-4 text-lg">
			In this challenge, the task is to facilitate sustainability reporting of global supply chains
			using AI.

			<b>Objective:</b> The AI should make data from a variety of sources usable for users, either in
			the form of reports or as answers to questionnaires. The goal is to create actionable information
			and data out of various sources.
