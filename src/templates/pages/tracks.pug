                  h3 Digital Journalism

            p The future of journalism is digital. But what does that mean for you as an attendee of hackaburg? Digital journalism is a contemporary form of journalism, in which isnews and features on current affairs, are presented solely or in combination with text, audio, video, or any other interactive form. It’s completely up to you, in which format you provide news or interesting information to the user. Think out of the box and try to develop new ways of  digital journalism.

            p The concept of a smart society integrates information and communication technology, and various physical devices connected to the network (the Internet of things or IoT) to optimize the efficiency of cities for example in general. But what really makes a building, a city or an building intelligent? How do you track efficiency, or your energy consumption to improve your environmental footprint? How would you use lighting systems to boost human comfort, mood and productivity? If you want to improve the working and living environments of people around you, then this track is for you!

            p Two things in life are certain: death and taxes. We can’t fix the latter, but recent technological advances have been pushing the former back by decades. How can we track our bodies to be healthier? How should we move and eat? Is biohacking or biotech the answer to our big questions about our health?

              p In this challenge an application software and its interfaces of mechatronical modules are to be developed. Each module can perform self-sufficiently and by combining more modules, a collaborated function is carried out automatically.
              p Background information: In the mechatronical software- and system development, functions are realized by combining mechanics, electric/electronic and software. Often mechatronical systems are primarily defined by their mechatronical interfaces and variants. In order to be able to meet today’s challenges, mechatronical systems must be developed by software and its interfaces. This enables the modularization of mechatronical components and leads to flexible systems.

            p The increasing number of digital documents in companies requires a good document management system. However, finding a specific document in a well-organized file store can still be tedious and time-consuming for employees. Despite the search function searching is often inconclusive because the document wasn’t provided with relevant annotations during the upload. Due to the fact that manual tagging of documents is an exhausting process for all users we want to find a way to automate this process.
            p Join our team. Let us create an intelligent application using machine-learning to makes manual tagging unnecessary.
            p We offer you a free DRACCON with tagged documents. You can start right away. It’s up to you.

              p The much awaited FIFA World Cup 2018 is underway. From June 12 to July 13, 32 national football teams would be competing against each other to lift the much coveted FIFA World Cup and be hailed as World Champions for the next four years. But, with all the available data in the current world, can we already predict, as to who would win? Can we add a dash of Data Science to the World Cup recipe? Can we use data to somehow account for the unaccountable factors such as referee mistakes, weaker teams scoring, player injuries, and many more and attempt to predict the outcome? Is it even possible?

              p Every minute counts for trauma surgeons! In order to save precious time, we want to develop a comfortable app for emergency physicians which allows to determine the injury severity of a trauma patient quickly and easily. Each of the numerous possible injuries is assigned to a numerical code, that accurately reflects the location and severity. The ISS calculation app aims to calculate the all over injury severity from the individual codes directly via the mobile phone. A great help when it comes to the care of severely injured patients.

              p Since 1923, Conrad loves to inspire and support tech-enthusiasts - therefore, we are excited to be part of Hackaburg 2018 and see the concepts and solutions you come up with. Together with you we want to explore the opportunities of a mobile multi-sensor IoT device. Our challenge focuses on the development of a useful application for the Sens'it IoT device that communicates via Sigfox. This device offers various sensors and a push button, which results in countless opportunities to develop various solutions.

              p Digitization is increasingly changing journalism. Artificial intelligence has found its way into a profession that was hitherto understood primarily as a craft. The term robo-journalism became a nightmare for many. But artificial intelligence should not replace the journalist. It should support him and make him more efficient. We are looking for ideas how Artificial Intelligence can advance local journalism – for example in the composition of themes or the editing / production of texts.

We are looking for innovative ideas that allow the reader to submit research requests; that give him the feeling of helping to shape the reporting.

              p Since the government is forcing the change to renewable energies by providing a financial incentive, also for private individuals, the prosumer was born. Energy production is switching to a more and more decentralized way of production, which makes the energy sector face some major challenges, primarily in network control.
              p We want to focus on how households can trade and exchange energy in the future. Picture a smaller representation of the energy market, described as a cell. Imagine participants of that cell to transfer and share overproduced power among their neighbors, fully automated and with a more simple billing process. The provided block chain implementation should be considered as a suggestion as the block chain is predicted to be the cutting edge technology to accomplish diverse challenges in various fields of application.
              p Which technological and organizational requirements arise with such a scenario? Is the block chain capable of handling these conditions or is there an even better approach? 
              p Now it’s up to you. Come up with your own model and scenario and/or extend the existing implementations to match them with your ideas.
